Python3 Websocket server
=======================

A simple websocket server written in Python 3

Current version: 0.1 Alpha

This websocket server is still under development.
Currently it supportes the latest Hybi websocket implementation and clients can send and receive text.

I work on this project in my free time so development wont go really fast. 

## Todo

* Add support for binairy data
* Add support for the old Hixie implementation? (Old apple iDevices still use this)
* Add SSL support
* Probably more
